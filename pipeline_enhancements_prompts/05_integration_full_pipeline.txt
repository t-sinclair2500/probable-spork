# Cursor Prompt: Integrate New Features into Full Pipeline & E2E Test

## Rule
Integrate storyboard asset loop, texture/paper feel, SVG path ops, and music bed policy into the existing procedural animation pipeline. Remove unused legacy steps.

## Success Criteria
- End-to-end run with “2-minute history of Ray and Charles Eames” prompt completes successfully.
- All new modules executed in correct order.
- Legacy unused modules removed from codebase.
- Duration target met (±5% tolerance).

## Test Criteria
- Run E2E test and confirm duration compliance.
- Inspect final video for:
  * Correct asset integration
  * Consistent texture/feel
  * Music bed applied
  * Procedural SVG morphs
- Validate acceptance tests pass.

## Implementation Guidance
- Centralize config in `/config/pipeline.yaml`.
- Define import order in `main.py`.
- Ensure all agents/modules use standardized naming from config.
- Run test harness after integration.

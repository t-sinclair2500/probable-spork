# Cursor Prompt: Implement Music Bed Policy & Selection Agent

## Rule
All videos must have a music bed selected and mixed to target loudness without overpowering narration.

## Success Criteria
- Music bed selected to match pacing (BPM) and tone of video.
- Track library stored locally or licensed from a provider.
- Automatic ducking during voiceover segments.
- Fades in/out aligned to scene transitions.

## Test Criteria
- For 3 test videos, verify music complements tone.
- Confirm narration is clearly audible over music.
- Ensure no abrupt music cuts.

## Implementation Guidance
- Use pydub for audio manipulation (mixing, ducking, fading).
- Tag music library with BPM and mood metadata.
- Match pacing KPI from script analysis to track BPM.
- Integrate into final assembly step post-render.

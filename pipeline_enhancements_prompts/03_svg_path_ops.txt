# Cursor Prompt: Implement Advanced SVG Path Operations

## Rule
SVG elements must support procedural transformations to create variant assets and dynamic motion effects directly in the renderer.

## Success Criteria
- Support path parsing, boolean ops, and geometric transforms.
- Morphing between shapes for animation effects.
- Ensure transformations respect layout constraints (safe area, no clipping).
- Procedurally generate new motif variants (boomerangs, starbursts, abstract cutouts).

## Test Criteria
- Generate 5 variant assets from a single base SVG motif.
- Verify no geometry overlaps outside safe bounds.
- Confirm visual coherence with brand design language.

## Implementation Guidance
- Use svgpathtools/svgelements for path parsing and manipulation.
- Use shapely + numpy for geometry math and safe area validation.
- Export generated assets via svgwrite.
- Integrate into asset generation agent and storyboard asset loop.

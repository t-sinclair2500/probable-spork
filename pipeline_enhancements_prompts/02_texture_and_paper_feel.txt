# Cursor Prompt: Add Texture & Paper Feel to Procedural Assets

## Rule
All SVG and rasterized elements in the animation pipeline should have a subtle, consistent texture overlay and edge styling inspired by mid-century modern print techniques.

## Success Criteria
- Texture mask generated once per render session and cached.
- Noise: opensimplex/perlin for organic grain.
- Edge treatment: scikit-image edge feathering and slight posterization.
- Halftone effect for midtones to simulate period-accurate printing.
- Apply uniformly without obscuring design details.

## Test Criteria
- Inspect 3 test frames from a generated animation to confirm consistent texture.
- Confirm no visible pattern tiling or artifacts.
- Ensure textures match defined brand palette and do not introduce new colors.

## Implementation Guidance
- Libraries: Pillow, opensimplex, scikit-image.
- Apply texture to raster layers in Pillow before MP4 encoding.
- Cache textures in `/cache/textures/` for reuse.
- Parameterize grain density, halftone size, and edge feather amount in a YAML config.

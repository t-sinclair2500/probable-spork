# Viral Growth Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Viral Growth Engine that extends the content pipeline with automated shorts generation and SEO packaging capabilities. The system is designed for maximum social media impact with deterministic, offline-capable processing.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Configuration Files
- **`conf/shorts.yaml`**: Complete configuration for shorts generation including crop settings, caption styling, overlay positioning, and encoding parameters
- **`conf/seo.yaml`**: SEO packaging templates, tag rules, chapter policies, and end screen configuration

### 2. Core Modules
- **`bin/viral/shorts.py`**: Main shorts generator with intelligent segment selection, 9:16 cropping, caption burning, and brand overlays
- **`bin/packaging/seo_packager.py`**: SEO content generator for descriptions, tags, chapters, and pinned comments
- **`bin/packaging/end_screens.py`**: End screen and CTA overlay renderer
- **`bin/utils/captions.py`**: Utility for SRT segmentation and ASS subtitle conversion

### 3. Pipeline Integration
- **Modified `bin/run_pipeline.py`**: Added four new steps to the pipeline:
  - `shorts_lab`: Creates 9:16 vertical clips (optional)
  - `seo_packaging`: Generates SEO content (required)
  - `end_screens`: Creates CTA overlays (optional)
- Proper step ordering and idempotent outputs configured

### 4. Testing & Documentation
- **`tests/test_shorts_selection_and_render.py`**: Unit tests for crop calculations and segment selection
- **`tests/test_seo_packaging.py`**: Unit tests for chapter formatting and keyword coverage
- **`bin/viral/demo_viral_growth.py`**: Comprehensive demo showing all features
- **`docs/viral_growth_engine.md`**: Complete documentation with usage examples

### 5. Asset Structure
- **`assets/brand/overlays/`**: Logo and subscribe button overlays
- **`assets/brand/cta/`**: CTA buttons and next video frames
- **`assets/brand/fonts/`**: Typography assets for captions and end screens

## Key Features Delivered

### Shorts Generation
- ✅ **Intelligent Selection**: Prefers viral-selected hooks, falls back to high-curiosity scenes
- ✅ **9:16 Conversion**: Configurable crop anchors (center, rule-of-thirds)
- ✅ **Caption Burning**: SRT to ASS conversion with custom styling
- ✅ **Brand Overlays**: Logo and subscribe button with configurable positioning
- ✅ **Audio Normalization**: Targets -14 LUFS for consistent loudness
- ✅ **Social Filenames**: Pattern-based naming with sanitized keywords

- ✅ **Reference Integration**: Domain extraction from research sources

### End Screens & CTAs
- ✅ **End Screen Images**: 1280×720 renders with brand elements
- ✅ **CTA Overlays**: Alpha-channel MOV files for video compositing
- ✅ **Design System**: Consistent palette and typography usage

## Technical Achievements

### Deterministic Processing
- Fixed seed ensures consistent results across runs
- Idempotent outputs prevent duplicate processing
- Offline-capable with no network dependencies

### Pipeline Integration
- Seamless integration with existing content pipeline
- Proper step dependencies and failure handling
- Configurable required/optional step policies

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Demo Results

The demo successfully demonstrates:
- **Segment Selection**: 3 clips selected (2 from hooks, 1 from early scenes)
- **Chapter Generation**: Proper timecode formatting and scene alignment
- **Keyword Extraction**: 10+ keywords extracted from title and content
- **Configuration Loading**: All YAML configs load correctly
- **Integration Ready**: All modules import and function properly

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Generate shorts from master video
python3 bin/viral/shorts.py --slug demo-viral

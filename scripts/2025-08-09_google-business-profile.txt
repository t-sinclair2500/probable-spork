This might seem like a small detail, but trust me, it's a game-changer for local SEO. You want to make sure that every single person searching for your practice online is going to find the same information - name, address, phone number - across all platforms.

Next up, let's talk about the power of reviews. Having good reviews on your Google Business Profile can do wonders for your practice's credibility and trustworthiness.

Tip #1: Establish a Bedtime Routine
Create a calming pre-sleep routine that includes activities like bath time, reading, and singing. This helps signal to your baby that it's time for sleep.

Stick to the same routine every night, even on weekends or during vacations. Consistency is key when it comes to helping your baby develop healthy sleep habits.

Tip #2: Watch for Sleepy Cues
Pay attention to your baby's sleepy cues, such as yawning, rubbing their eyes, or becoming less active.

When you notice these cues, it's time to put your baby to bed. Don't wait until they're overtired, as this can make it harder for them to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Tip #3: Create a Sleep-Conducive Environment
Make sure the room is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using white noise machines or a fan to block out any background noise.

Invest in blackout curtains or shades to keep the room dark, which can help regulate your baby's circadian rhythms.

Tip #4: Avoid Overstimulation
Avoid stimulating activities or exposing your baby to bright lights and loud noises close to bedtime.

Try to wind down before bed with relaxing activities like reading, singing, or giving a gentle massage. This can help signal to your baby that it's time for sleep.

# Phase 6 Fix Queue Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all Phase 6 fixes for the Operator Console, making it reliable, secure-by-default, and pleasant to operate.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Events Schema Hardening ✓
- **Event validation**: Added Pydantic validators for all event fields
- **JSONL sink**: Events now written to `runs/<id>/events.jsonl` files
- **Malformed payload rejection**: Invalid events are rejected with clear error messages
- **SSE heartbeat**: 5-second heartbeat implemented for all SSE connections
- **Event routing**: Events include required `job_id` field for proper routing

**Files modified:**
- `fastapi_app/models.py` - Added Event validation and new response models
- `fastapi_app/events.py` - Implemented JSONL writing and heartbeat

### 2. Auth/CORS Defaults ✓
- **127.0.0.1 binding**: Enforced by default for security
- **Bearer token auth**: Uses `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable
- **CORS disabled by default**: Only enabled for localhost UI connections
- **Local binding guard**: Prevents external binding unless explicitly allowed

**Files modified:**
- `fastapi_app/security.py` - Added local binding enforcement and CORS defaults
- `fastapi_app/config.py` - Added UI configuration and validation
- `fastapi_app/__init__.py` - Enforced security at startup

### 3. HITL Gates Reliability ✓
- **Approve/Reject with JSON patch**: Support for artifact modification
- **Durable on disk**: Gate decisions stored in database and events
- **Reflected in re-run**: Gate state persists across job restarts
- **Patch validation**: JSON patch structure validated before application

**Files modified:**
- `fastapi_app/models.py` - Enhanced GateAction with patch support
- `fastapi_app/routes.py` - Updated gate endpoints for patch handling

### 4. Stage Adapters ✓
- **Module call wrapping**: Stage execution wrapped with proper error handling
- **Artifact capture**: All stage outputs captured and registered
- **Error propagation**: Failures marked as `failed` with clear context
- **Event logging**: Comprehensive event logging for all stage operations

**Files modified:**
- `fastapi_app/events.py` - Added stage-specific event methods
- `fastapi_app/orchestrator.py` - Enhanced error handling and artifact capture

### 5. Runbook + Smoke ✓
- **One-command startup**: `make op-console` launches API+UI
- **Smoke script**: `scripts/smoke_op_console.sh` exercises full path
- **Health endpoint**: `/healthz` accessible without authentication
- **Comprehensive testing**: Test script validates all functionality

**Files modified:**
- `Makefile` - Added operator console targets
- `test_phase6_fixes.py` - Created comprehensive test script
- `scripts/smoke_op_console.sh` - Enhanced smoke testing

## New Features Added

### Event System
- **Real-time streaming**: SSE with 5-second heartbeat
- **Polling fallback**: JSON endpoint for non-SSE clients
- **Structured logging**: All events logged with proper tags
- **File persistence**: Events stored in JSONL format for durability

### Security Enhancements
- **Local-only binding**: Server binds to 127.0.0.1 by default
- **Token validation**: Bearer token required for all protected endpoints
- **CORS configuration**: Automatic UI origin detection and configuration
- **Security logging**: Comprehensive security status reporting

### Gate Management
- **JSON patch support**: Modify artifacts during gate decisions
- **Patch validation**: Ensures patch structure is valid
- **State persistence**: Gate decisions stored and retrievable
- **Auto-approval**: Configurable timeouts for optional gates

### UI Improvements
- **Two-page interface**: Config/Launch + Job Console
- **Real-time updates**: Live event streaming and job status
- **Gate controls**: Approve/Reject with patch support
- **Artifact viewing**: Browse generated artifacts by stage

## Configuration

### Operator Configuration (`conf/operator.yaml`)
```yaml
server:
  host: "127.0.0.1"  # Local-only by default
  port: 8008
  allow_external_bind: false  # Security setting

security:
  admin_token_env: "ADMIN_TOKEN"
  cors:
    enabled: false  # Disabled by default
    allow_origins: []  # Auto-configured for UI

ui:
  port: 7860
  features:
    real_time_updates: true
    sse_enabled: true
```

### Environment Variables
- `ADMIN_TOKEN`: Bearer token for authentication (defaults to config value)

## Usage

### Starting the Console
```bash
# Start both API and UI
make op-console

# Start only API
make op-console-api

# Start only UI
make op-console-ui
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run smoke test
make op-console-smoke

# Run comprehensive test
python test_phase6_fixes.py
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /healthz` - Health check (no auth required)
- `GET /api/v1/jobs` - List jobs (auth required)
- `POST /api/v1/jobs` - Create job (auth required)
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/events` - Get job events (auth required)
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}/events/stream` - SSE stream (auth required)

## Success Criteria Met

### ✓ Console Launch
- `make op-console` successfully launches API+UI
- Token required for all endpoints except `/healthz`
- Local binding enforced (127.0.0.1)

### ✓ Job Lifecycle
- Start job → reaches Script gate → Reject with patch → Resume → Approve → completes
- Artifacts downloadable and properly tracked
- Events logged to JSONL files

### ✓ SSE and Polling
- SSE shows live events with 5-second heartbeats
- Polling returns same events via JSON endpoint
- Both methods provide consistent data

### ✓ Security
- Unauthorized routes return 401
- CORS enabled only for UI host
- Local binding enforced by default

## Testing Results

### Smoke Test
```bash
$ make op-console-smoke
✓ API health check passed
✓ Authentication required (401 returned)
✓ Valid token accepted
✓ Job creation successful
✓ Events endpoint working
✓ JSONL file created
✓ Gate management working
```

### Comprehensive Test
```bash
$ python test_phase6_fixes.py
✓ All Phase 6 tests passed!
The operator console is working correctly.
```

## Log Tags Implemented

- `[api]` - API server operations
- `[orchestrator]` - Pipeline orchestration
- `[stage]` - Stage execution
- `[gate]` - HITL gate operations
- `[events]` - Event system operations
- `[ui]` - User interface operations
- `[security]` - Security operations
- `[config]` - Configuration operations

## Next Steps

1. **Production deployment**: Update `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable
2. **Monitoring**: Add metrics collection for production use
3. **Backup**: Implement automated backup of events and artifacts
4. **Scaling**: Consider Redis for event streaming in multi-instance deployments

## Conclusion

All Phase 6 fixes have been successfully implemented. The Operator Console is now:
- **Reliable**: Events persisted to disk, proper error handling
- **Secure**: Local-only binding, token authentication, CORS disabled by default
- **Operable**: One-command startup, comprehensive testing, clear logging
- **Maintainable**: Well-structured code, proper separation of concerns

The system is ready for production use with proper security configuration.

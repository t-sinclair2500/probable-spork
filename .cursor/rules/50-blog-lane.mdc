Generation
- Rewrite script to Markdown honoring `blog.tone`, word bounds, and `include_faq` and CTA.
- Prefer reusing shared assets for inline images; include alt text.

Rendering
- Sanitize HTML, inject schema.org Article JSON-LD, optionally add attribution block.

SEO
- Enforce title ≤ 65 chars, meta ≤ 160 chars, clean slug. Provide `--allow-fail` override for gate when developing.

Posting
- Use WordPress REST with non-admin poster user and Application Password.
- Upload media (featured + inline). Choose featured per `featured_image_strategy`.
- Dry-run default; enable live posting only when explicitly configured.

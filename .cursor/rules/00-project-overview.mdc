alwaysApply: true

- This repo targets Mac M2 8GB (local-first) primary, Raspberry Pi 5 supported secondary: Ollama, whisper.cpp, Coqui TTS, FFmpeg/MoviePy, Python.
- Heavy tasks must run sequentially and be lock-aware (single lane).
- Idempotence required: re-running any step should short-circuit if outputs already exist.
- Operator control lives in `conf/global.yaml` and `conf/blog.yaml`; secrets in `.env`.
- Licensing: record and respect provider license terms; include attribution when required.
- Shared artifacts power multiple lanes (YouTube + Blog) from the same source of truth.

Verify
- Changes do not introduce parallel heavy work that violates the single-lane constraint.
- No hardcoded secrets or device-specific paths slipped into code.

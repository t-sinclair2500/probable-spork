## Current Source of Truth

For all current tasks, milestones, and acceptance criteria, see:
- **`MASTER_TODO.md`** — Canonical task list with status board and V2 roadmap

- **`PURPOSE_SUMMARY.md`** — High-level overview and success criteria

These files are kept for historical reference but should not be used for current planning.

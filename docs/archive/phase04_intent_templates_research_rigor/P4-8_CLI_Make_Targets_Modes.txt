# Prompt P4-8 — CLI & Make Targets + Modes (Reuse vs Live) for Research

ROLE: Developer experience engineer
FIRST: Read README in this zip, then proceed.

OBJECTIVE
Provide ergonomic CLIs and Make targets to run research in either `reuse` or `live` mode and to inspect caches and coverage quickly.

MANDATORY CONTEXT
- Modules from P4-3..P4-6
- Makefile (or create), OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md

REQUIREMENTS
- CLIs:
  - `python bin/trending_intake.py --mode reuse|live ...`
  - `python bin/research_collect.py --slug <slug> --mode reuse|live --max 50`
  - `python bin/research_ground.py --slug <slug>`
  - `python bin/fact_guard.py --slug <slug>`
- Make targets:
  - `make research-reuse SLUG=<slug>` (collect from cache → ground → fact-guard)
  - `make research-live SLUG=<slug>` (live fetch → cache → ground → fact-guard; obey rate limits)
  - `make research-report SLUG=<slug>` (prints citations stats and coverage)
- Logs must include the tags from README.

DELIVERABLES
- New CLIs/targets; brief notes in OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Operator can run both modes; outputs deterministic in reuse mode.
- Research-report prints a compact summary (min/max checks).

TEST CRITERIA (paste outputs)
1) `make research-reuse SLUG=eames-history`
2) `make research-report SLUG=eames-history`

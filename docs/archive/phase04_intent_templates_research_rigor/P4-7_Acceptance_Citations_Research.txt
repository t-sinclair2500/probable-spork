# Prompt P4-7 â€” Acceptance: Citations, Domain Quality, Research Coverage

ROLE: Acceptance engineer
FIRST: Read README in this zip, then proceed.

OBJECTIVE
Extend acceptance to validate research quality and coverage and to surface a concise citations dashboard.

MANDATORY CONTEXT
- Acceptance: `bin/acceptance.py`
- Artifacts: `references.json`, `grounded_beats.json`, `fact_guard_report.json`
- Config: `conf/research.yaml` (min counts, whitelists)

REQUIREMENTS
- Add an `evidence` section with:
  - Counts: total citations, unique domains, beats coverage (% >=1).
  - Policy checks: min citations per intent; whitelist compliance; WARN on non-whitelisted unless override flag.
  - Fact-guard summary: removed/rewritten/flagged counts; FAIL if flagged > 0 in strict mode.
- Write `evidence` block to `acceptance_results.json` and copy key stats into `videos/<slug>.metadata.json`.

DELIVERABLES
- Acceptance extended with clear PASS/WARN/FAIL outcomes on research.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- E2E acceptance passes in reuse mode for Eames; clear evidence dashboard present.

TEST CRITERIA (paste outputs)
1) `python bin/acceptance.py && jq '.evidence' acceptance_results.json`
2) Show coverage % and unique domain count.

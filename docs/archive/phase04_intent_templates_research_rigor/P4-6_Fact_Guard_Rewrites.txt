# Prompt P4-6 — Fact Guard (Claim Checking, Rewrites, Redlines)

ROLE: Fact-checking engineer
FIRST: Read README in this zip, then proceed.

OBJECTIVE
Enforce that factual claims in the script are supported by references. Remove or rewrite ungrounded claims and produce a fact-guard report.

MANDATORY CONTEXT
- Inputs: script text (draft), `grounded_beats.json`, `references.json`
- Module: `bin/fact_guard.py`
- Output: `fact_guard_report.json`, cleaned script

REQUIREMENTS
- Identify claims that require evidence (proper nouns, dates, “first/most/best” superlatives).
- For each claim:
  - If supported by citations in its beat: OK.
  - If unsupported: either remove or rewrite to a cautious form **or** add a TODO flag for operator (configurable strictness).
- Produce `fact_guard_report.json` with `{kept, removed, rewritten, flagged}` and rationale.
- Logging: `[fact-guard]` with summary stats.

DELIVERABLES
- A cleaned, citation-safe script and detailed report.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- No orphan claims remain; script reads smoothly.
- Deterministic decisions with same inputs.

TEST CRITERIA (paste outputs)
1) Summary counts from `fact_guard_report.json`.
2) One example of a rewritten line with old→new text.

# Phase 3 Audit Report — Visual Polish: Textures & SVG Geometry

**Audit Date:** 2025-08-14  
**Auditor:** Implementation Auditor  
**Phase:** Phase 3 — Visual Polish: Textures & SVG Geometry  

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 has been **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** with significant progress on core components but several gaps that prevent full compliance with requirements.

**Overall Status:** WARN (Partial Implementation)

## Detailed Findings

### P3-1: Texture Engine Core ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Texture engine fully functional with grain, feather, posterize, halftone
- Performance: 97.2% improvement on subsequent runs (exceeds 15% requirement)
- PIL 9.5.0 posterize bug fixed with level clamping

### P3-2: Texture Integration + QA Loop ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Basic integration present but QA loop needs testing
- Auto-dial-back mechanism not fully verified

### P3-3: SVG Geometry Engine Core ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Core functions implemented but SVGGeometryEngine class incomplete
- Geometry validation shows 0 critical errors
- Path morphing and icon assembly working

### P3-4: Micro-Animations ❌ FAILS
- System implemented but exceeds 10% limit (16.67% observed)
- Limit enforcement not working correctly

### P3-5: Acceptance Extensions ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Visual polish validation fully integrated
- Performance tracking in place

### P3-6: Style Presets & Probe Tooling ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- 8 named presets working
- Texture probe tool functional

## Critical Issues
1. Micro-animation limit enforcement (exceeds 10%)
2. SVGGeometryEngine class incomplete
3. QA loop testing needed

## Compliance: WARN (Partial Implementation)

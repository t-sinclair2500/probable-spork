# Generated: 2025-08-12 06:14:35Z UTC

## CONTEXT TO REVIEW (MANDATORY)
- Read repo_audit_probable_spork_v2.md top sections (Orchestrator, Acceptance).
- Open: conf/global.yaml, conf/render.yaml, conf/blog.yaml, conf/brief.yaml (or brief.md front‑matter).
- Inspect: bin/run_pipeline.py, bin/assemble_video.py, existing voice/acceptance steps.
- Use centralized names from sdk: SceneScript, Element, Keyframe, BrandStyle, Beat, Animatic Clip.

## WORKING FRAMEWORK — THINK → PLAN → APPLY → VERIFY
- THINK: Summarize constraints, dependencies, and risks (≤10 bullets). Reference this prompt’s RULES.
- PLAN: List exact files, functions, signatures, schemas; step-by-step edits; rollback.
- APPLY: Implement code, keep diffs small & cohesive; instrument logs.
- VERIFY: Run the Test Criteria commands and paste outputs + a date-stamped changelog at the bottom of the file.

ROLE: Final cut engineer.

GOAL
- Assemble final video from animatic clips with smooth transitions and coverage enforcement.

RULES
- Visual coverage ≥ 0.85; ≤ 1 transition / 6s; default dissolve.

TASKS
1) Update `bin/assemble_video.py` to ingest `assets/<slug>/animatics/s*.mp4` in order and meet coverage.
2) Write `videos/<slug>.metadata.json` with: coverage, scene_map, durations.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Coverage ≥ 0.85, transitions rule met, metadata written.

TEST CRITERIA
python bin/assemble_video.py --slug demo
jq '.' videos/demo.metadata.json

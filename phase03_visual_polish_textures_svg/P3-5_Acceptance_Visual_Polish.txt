# Prompt P3-5 — Acceptance Extensions for Visual Polish (Textures/Geometry/Micro‑Anim)

ROLE: Acceptance engineer
FIRST: Read README in this zip, then proceed.

OBJECTIVE
Extend acceptance to validate visual polish quality and performance budgets, and surface texture/geometry/micro‑animation details in results.

MANDATORY CONTEXT
- Acceptance: `bin/acceptance.py`
- Metadata paths: `videos/<slug>.metadata.json`
- Artifacts: `runs/<slug>/style_signature.json`, `runs/<slug>/geom_validation_report.json`

REQUIREMENTS
- Checks:
  - If `textures.enable=true`, confirm metadata shows textures applied and contrast remains PASS.
  - If `geometry.enable=true`, ensure `geom_validation_report.json` exists and has 0 critical errors.
  - If `micro_anim.enable=true`, ensure ≤10% elements animated per scene and no collisions after animation keyframes.
  - Performance: report scene render time delta with textures ON vs OFF; WARN if >15% average increase.
- Results:
  - Add `visual_polish` block to `acceptance_results.json` with PASS/WARN/FAIL and key metrics.

DELIVERABLES
- Enhanced acceptance with `visual_polish` block and clear operator hints on failures.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- E2E acceptance passes with textures ON; geometry validated; micro‑anim within policy.
- Operator can read one JSON to understand visual polish status.

TEST CRITERIA (paste outputs)
1) `python bin/acceptance.py && jq '.visual_polish' acceptance_results.json`
2) Show performance delta numbers (textures on vs off).

# Prompt P3-6 — Operator Ergonomics: Style Presets & Probe Tooling

ROLE: Developer experience engineer
FIRST: Read README in this zip, then proceed.

OBJECTIVE
Provide easy operator controls and probes for visual polish: style presets and a quick probe tool to preview textures on representative frames.

MANDATORY CONTEXT
- Configs: `conf/render.yaml` (extend), `design/design_language.json` (palette)
- Tools: `bin/cutout/texture_engine.py`, renderer hooks

REQUIREMENTS
- Style presets:
  - Add `conf/style_presets.yaml` with named presets (e.g., `print-soft`, `print-strong`, `flat-noise`), mapping to texture params.
  - CLI flag/env to select a preset which overrides `conf/render.yaml` texture params (without editing the file).
- Probe tooling:
  - Create `bin/texture_probe.py` to render a grid of small previews across (grain_strength × posterize_levels × halftone on/off) for one representative frame; save to `runs/<slug>/texture_probe_grid.png`.
- Logging: record chosen preset and resolved parameters.

DELIVERABLES
- Style presets file and probe script with help text.
- Updated OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md describing how to pick a preset and run probe.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Operator can try presets quickly and see results without a full render.
- Selected preset is reflected in metadata and logs.

TEST CRITERIA (paste outputs)
1) `python bin/texture_probe.py --slug <slug> --preset print-soft`
2) Show path to `texture_probe_grid.png` and the resolved params in logs.
